    {
      "question": "Why did you transition from commerce to AI/ML?",
      "answer": "The transition from commerce to AI/ML was a result of an unexpected turn in my career journey. After completing my bachelor's degree in commerce, I was fortunate to land a job at Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Trainee. Despite having no prior experience in coding or programming, coming from a core commerce background, my eagerness to learn and quick adaptability caught the attention of my trainers. CTS gave me an opportunity, and during the initial 45-day training period and assessment, I performed exceptionally well in Java, which helped me secure a position in the development team. This was a remarkable achievement, as many computer science graduates typically end up in support roles. However, after working for a year, I realized that while I had developed a passion for programming, I still felt disconnected from my original interest in business and commerce. I knew I had to find a way to combine both my love for programming and my interest in business. That's when I discovered data science and machine learning, which seemed like the perfect intersection. With this newfound clarity, I embarked on a journey to master AI/ML, and now, I am truly enjoying the blend of technology and business that this field offers."

      "question": "What unique qualities do you bring to the table?",

    {
      "question": "What is your most innovative project?",
      "answer": "The most innovative project is an AI-powered Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed to Reduce order time and order errors. I'm currently working with my college to secure intellectual property rights, so I can't disclose the full extent of its capabilities at this time. However, I'm confident that this project has the potential to significantly impact the restaurant industry."
